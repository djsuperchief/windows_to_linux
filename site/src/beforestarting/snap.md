If you have chosen to disable Snaps then you can find plenty of help around the internet to achieve this. The source I used is [this](https://gitlab.com/scripts94/kubuntu-get-rid-of-snap).

# Removing Snap - TLDR Edition
Download and run the script in the above link. To run the script, you can either edit the permissions in your file browser (Dolphin for Kubuntu) or run the following:

```
chmod +x <script file>
```

It is a good idea to remove the script once you have finished.

Once the script has completed, Snap should no longer be providing your software updates.
