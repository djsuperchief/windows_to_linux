# Gaming Related Software

I am listing all gaming specific software on this page that is worth downloading.

# Discord

Ok, not specifically related to gaming but still it's probably its main use. Simply go to the [Discord Download page](https://discord.com/download) and click the "Download for Linux" button.

You can now run the package file it downloaded for your distribution.

You may need to run the `dpkg` fix from the [software](./) page.

# Steam

Steam is a given for gaming these days and you can probably find it in your application manager (like Discover). However if you prefer to get Steam from source, as it were (no pun intended), go to the [Steam Download page](https://store.steampowered.com/about/) and install for your distribution.

# Lutris

[Lutris](https://lutris.net/) is a game launcher that allows you to run games from all sorts of different launchers such as Epic games, EA, GOG and more. Again, you can probably find this in your application launcher and if you do, remember to check the source first before blindly clicking install. I say this because the Ubuntu version is often out of date compared to the Flathub copy.
Alternatively you can install it by [downloading](https://lutris.net/downloads) directly from their site.

# R2modman

[R2modman](https://r2modman.com/) is a popular modding client that allows you to add mods to some of your games. I use it for `Peak` and `Risk Of Rain 2`.
I would advise to download the `AppImage` from their download page.
