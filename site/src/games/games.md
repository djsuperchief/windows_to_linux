# Games
I have tested a number of games on Linux and below are the ones I have tested along with any notes about those games. Please note this list is at the moment incomplete as I move content over.

# "State" Of Games

A good resource to determine if games are working is [ProtonDB](https://www.protondb.com/). Steam uses something called Proton to run Windows only games on Linux and ProtonDB details what games are working, what games require a tweak and what isn't working. It is an excellent source for determining if something will work on your system but like everything....milage may vary.
I am doing my own testing on games I play regularly and noting what works, what doesn't and any fixes i have found. So in short the "State" of games is whether they are working on my setup.
