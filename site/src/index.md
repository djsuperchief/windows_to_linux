# About This Project
This site is about moving from Windows to Linux as your main OS. It has a heavy focus on gaming as the driver for this move but it will also lightly cover development, office based apps and music production.

This was created because of my own need to move to Linux and is being actively worked on as I test Linux as a main OS.

# Why
So this exists because I do not want to upgrade to Windows 11. There is enough in the OS that is simply not for me (at a technical level) and
I simply do not want to upgrade if I don't have to. That said I want to keep getting security updates and at this point I have a few choices:

- Pay for Windows 10 Updates
- Upgrade to Windows 11
- Move To Mac
- Move To Linux

## Pay for Windows 10 Updates
Well this is certainly a feasible approach as the fee will be around Â£30 (or equivalent for your country). I could also use Microsoft Reward
Points which are easy enough to earn but this is not something that is going to last long term. Microsoft will eventually stop providing security updates and I can't expect them to keep supporting Windows 10 until I stop being able to use a computer.

## Upgrade To Windows 11
I don't want to do this (as already stated) and this is the last possible scenario I will go to if all else fails.

## Move To Mac
This would involve buying all new hardware and spending a lot of cash on a system that isn't really built for gaming (my personal opinion).
I cannot justify the cost and personally it is not an ecosystem that will work for me for gaming.

## Move To Linux
This is the most likely move and one that is more likely to end up in success. With the Steam Deck, a lot of effort has gone into Linux for gaming and it is far more capable of gaming now than it has ever been. There are plenty of flavours of Linux to choose from and there is so much help out there that I should be able to get up and running in a relatively short amount of time.
There is also the gap in terms of drivers and compatibility with my hardware. I'm sure there is something out there for my hardware or something generic enough that it will work. All I have to do is work out do the pros out weigh the cons (for instance, "it just works" on Windows and there may be an effort to get it to work on Linux) and figure out if the sacrifices I make (and there will be some) are worth the effort of moving away from Windows.

# What This Is Not
This is **NOT** a bash Microsoft exercise. Windows will probably be fine for a large portion of the population but it isn't for me. I have used Windows as my main OS since Windows 95 and I have also used Windows 3.1. I use Linux and Mac day to day for work so I don't consider myself to have a bias for any of the OS's. I want to explore what my choices are so I don't have to move to Windows 11 and do what is right for me as a gamer, developer and music producer.

# I Am Not A Linux Expert
Yea that. I am not a Linux expert by any stretch of the imagination. What you see here is the result of my own experimentation, mishaps, failures and successes. I have spent countless hours and perhaps even days solving issues to arrive at what I feel is the __right solution for me__. If what I have learnt or tried out will benefit someone else on a similar journey then it's all for the greater good.

# Instructions
Please note that the instructions I am writing will be using Kubuntu so you will need to adapt them to the Linux version you have chosen.

# Updating
I will update this site as I go along with various findings, tests and installation instructions for various hardware and software. This is not a defacto standard and I am far from an expert. It goes without saying that anything noted on this site is tried at your own risk and I accept no responsibility for anything going wrong. You should do your own research as well to ensure what you are doing is safe. That said, if I do something and it ends up going wrong, I will tell you about it so you are forewarned.

On that note, I am slowly moving all the content from the repositories readme to this site so it is a little more organised instead of in one big...brain dump. So until this paragraph disappears, assume that I am still doing this.
