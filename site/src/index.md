Windows To Linux

# About
This site is about moving from Windows to Linux as your main OS. It has a heavy focus on gaming as the driver for this move but it will also lightly cover development, office based apps and music production.

This was created because of my own need to move to Linux and is being actively worked on as I test Linux as a main OS.

# Updating
I will update this site as I go along with various findings, tests and installation instructions for various hardware and software. This is not a defacto standard and I am far from an expert. It goes without saying that anything noted on this site is tried at your own risk and I accept no responsibility for anything going wrong. You should do your own research as well to ensure what you are doing is safe. That said, if I do something and it ends up going wrong, I will tell you about it so you are forewarned.
