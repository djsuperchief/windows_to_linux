# Windows To Linux

Welcome to my personal "blog / site" for my journey from Windows to Linux. I hope that if you happen
to have stumbled on this repo that you are looking for some handy hints, tips etc for making the move yourself.

All of the content has been moved to the github site [here](https://djsuperchief.github.io/windows_to_linux/) and is where all the updates
will be from now on.

I hope you find this useful and I will try and keep is as up to date as I can.
